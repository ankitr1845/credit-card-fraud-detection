# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. Using advanced classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, the model analyzes transaction patterns to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training on a real or synthetic dataset, ensuring robustness against imbalanced data through techniques like SMOTE and anomaly detection. Built with Python, libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used for model development and visualization. The system can be integrated into financial platforms to provide real-time fraud detection, helping prevent financial losses. Future enhancements include improving model accuracy with deep learning, integrating real-time transaction monitoring, and deploying the system as an API for seamless integration with banking applications. This project serves as a valuable tool in combating financial fraud and ensuring secure digital transactions.
